The main goal of our project was to introduce the possibility of learning through
games, focusing specifically on some of the courses taught in engineering education.
Classroom education is the most dominant approach to teaching in most countries, and
while it provides various benefits that cannot be replaced by other approaches,
classroom education alone is not enough. Learning outside the classroom is as
essential as learning inside it, as Education is not only about acquiring knowledge but
also about understanding the situations to which this knowledge applies among many
other things. Outside Education not only provides the chance to understand difficult
concepts more quickly but also gives a deeper understanding of fundamental
concepts.

Traditional Education focuses more on standardized curriculum and passing tests as
opposed to student-focused learning; it lacks interactivity and focuses more on the
theoretical which may provide little context and lead to the learners to disconnect later
on. Technology brings changes to education such as more flexibility, more focus on
the learning process then on grades and more variety than that limited by your
location.

Games in Education is an approach that provides interactivity, flexibility and the
challenge to prevent boredom or losing the motivation to complete learning difficult
concepts. This thesis improves the engineering education through adding interactivity
and gaming.
